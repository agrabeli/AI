These scripts are written in python 2.7 and require you to install what is in
`requirements.txt`.


It is highly recommended you do so [inside of a
virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html)

To install the dependencies just run (ideally from the virtualenv):

```
pip install requirements.txt
```
